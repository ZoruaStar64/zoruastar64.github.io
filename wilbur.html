<h2>What does Wilbur do?</h2>
<p>Wilbur currently only does the singleplayer portion of the game<br>
and is seen in a cutscene of the multiplayer rides to other islands<br>he is also seen at the end of a cutscene when you arrive back on your own island</p>
<p>on island tours he is seen waiting beside the airplane<br>when talking to him he gives you three dialogue options<br>
The top option being to return back to your island and finishing the tour.<br>the middle option will be asking him for new tools<br>
This will cost you 100 Nook miles every tool.<br>
The bottom option being a cancel option to get back to your tour.</p>
<p>it's also to be assumed that he is the one talking to the player<br>
when in the plane cutscenes during the opening and Multiplayer cutscenes.</p>
