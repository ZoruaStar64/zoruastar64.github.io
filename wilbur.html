<h2>What does Wilbur do?</h2>
<p>Wilbur currently only does the singleplayer portion of the game<br>
and is seen in a cutscene of the multiplayer rides to other islands.<br>He is also seen at the end of a cutscene when you arrive back on your own island.</p>
<p>On island tours he is seen waiting beside the airplane.<br>When talking to him he gives you three dialogue options:<br>
the top option being to return back to your island and finishing the tour,<br>the middle option will be asking him for new tools<br>
this will cost you 100 Nook miles every tool and<br>
the bottom option being a cancel option to get back to your tour.</p>
<p>It's also to be assumed that he is the one talking to the player<br>
in the plane cutscenes during the opening and Multiplayer cutscenes.</p>
