<img src="images/Resident services tent.png" alt="Picture of the resident services tent" width="250px" height="141px">
<p>The player is able to talk to Tom Nook at all times inside the resident services tent/building.<br> and ask him a couple of questions.</p>
<p>Among these questions are "what should i do?" in which Tom gives the player advice on what to do or gives the player a story related task such as finding a place for a building.</p>
<p>When the player has upgraded the resident services tent to a building Isabelle will move in there and Tom will have new dialogue and things you can do with him.
<br>Among these new things are building ramps/stairs and bridges to have easier access on your island,<br>however if you do this you will have to slowly but surely donate money to lloid and once the bell requirement is met lloid will have the bridge/incline finished the next day first minute.
