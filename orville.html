<p>Orville is a male dodo, who is accompanied by his colleague <a href="wilbur.html">Wilbur</a>, who is also a male dodo.<br>

<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
<p>When inside the Dodo Airlines building the player can talk to Orville<br>
to do many different things, one of those being Local/Online multiplayer.<br>
The player can send mail to other players and attach items to them to send presents<br>
and to send the other player a nice message.<br>
You can also talk to Orville to make him open the gates to your island.<br>
This way other players can visit your island.<br>
The player however MUST choose between Local or Online multiplayer.<br>
The player can't have a local friend playing with an online friend at the same time.<br>
The player can tell Orville that they want to visit a friend (either Local or Online)<br>
and at that point the player connects to the visiting player's device and visit their island.</p>

<h2>Singleplayer</h2>
<p>In singleplayer circumstances, if the player has a Nook Miles Ticket,<br>
they will be able to go on a tour once they select the dialogue option at Orville.<br>
At that point Orville will contact <a href="wilbur.html">Wilbur</a> to send the player on an island tour.</p>
