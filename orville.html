They work together at Dodo Airlines to bring the player to islands or to bring others<br>to the player's island.</p>
<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
<p>When inside the Dodo Airlines building the player can talk to orville<br>
to do many different things with one of those being Local/Online multiplayer.<br>
The player can send mail to other players and attach items to them to send presents<br>
and to send the other player a nice message.<br>
You can also talk to Orville to make him open the gates to your island<br>
this way other players can visit your island.<br>
The player however MUST choose between Local or Online multiplayer<br>
the player can't have a local friend playing with an online friend at the same time.<br>
The player can tell Orville that they want to visit a friend (either Local or Online)<br>
at that point the player connects to the visiting player's device and visit their island.</p>

<h2>Singleplayer</h2>
<p>In singleplayer circumstances if the player has a Nook Miles Ticket<br>
they will be able to go on a tour once selecting the option at Orville.<br>
at that point Orville will contact Wilbur to send the player towards a tour island.</p>
