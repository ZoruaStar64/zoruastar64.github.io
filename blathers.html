<p>When <a href="tom_nook.html">Tom Nook</a> gets a call from Blathers the player is asked by <a href="tom_nook.html">Tom Nook</a><br>
if the player can find 5 different kinds of fish or bugs so Blathers comes to the island</p>
<p>When Blathers arrives he resides in a tent and he asks the player to get him<br>
15 different kinds of fish, bugs or fossils.<br>
afterwards construction on the actual museum building will start</p>
<p>once the Museum is built the player can once again donate to it<br>
and they can now check out exhibits for each of the 3 categories<br>them being fish, bugs and fossils.</p>

<p>Blathers loves to blather about fossils, fish and bugs.<br>
Just to note Blathers HATES bugs and is scared of the most harmless of all<br>
aside from that fact he is still knoledgable on the topic of them.</p>
<p>Blathers also has a sister called Celeste who comes to the island<br>
as a special visitor(character) and gives the player a recipe<br>
for either a wand or a zodiac inspired furniture piece.</p>
