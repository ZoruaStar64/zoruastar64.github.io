<p>Sable is a female hedgehog and the older sister of <a href="mabel.html">Mabel</a><br>
Sable is a shy and reserved type of person<br>
and she prefers to work unnoticed while <a href="mabel.html">Mabel</a> deals with the customers.</p>
<p>Sable is also great friends with <a href="tom_nook.html">Tom Nook</a>.</p>

<h2>What's Sable's role in New Horizons?</h2>
<p>Sable currently just works at the sewing machine<br>like in the older games and you can also befriend her like then.<br>
Upon befriending her, which takes about a week,<br>she will give you fabric, that you can use to wear or put on furniture.</p>
