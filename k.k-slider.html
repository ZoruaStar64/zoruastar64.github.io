<p>K.K Slider is a male Jack Russel breed dog<br>Who's also well known in and outside the animal crossing universe.<br>
He has a total of 291 songs from the original animal crossing to new leaf.<br>
K.K Slider is a hippie-style traveling musician, this is reflected in his speech<br>
He comes across somebody who wants to be liberated,<br>
which is why he doesn't put prices on his music and offers to perform for others.</p>
<h2>What does K.K Slider do in New Horizons?</h2>
<p>In New Horizons after upgrading the Resident Services building,<br>
<a href="tom_nook.html">Tom Nook</a> will give the player a goal of improving the island<br>
This is to convince K.K to play a concert on your island.<br>
Once the required 3 star rating is met K.K will arrive the following day<br>
after that he will arrive every saturday<br>to play a concert in the evening.</p>
<p>The player may request songs and like in the previous games<br>the player will recieve a copy of the first song they request.<br>
On the player's birthday (or the saturday before) they can request K.K to play K.K. Birthday<br>Which sounds almost exactly like the in real life song "Happy birthday to you"</p>
