<h1>Harvey</h1>
<img src="images/Harvey_HD.png" alt="Picture of Harvey" width="142px" height="142px">
<p>Harvey is a male spaniel breed dog who resembles a stereotypical hippie.<br>
which is why he acts absentminded, loves nature and animals and doesn't like technology.<br>
He is also vegan</p>
<h2>What does Harvey do in New Horizons?</h2>
<p>In New Horizons Harvey first meets up with the player<br>
once they've gotten their third villager to move in.<br>
Harvey arrives on the players island to compliment them<br>
for the rapid development of the player's island and explains<br>
that he lives by himself on another island nearby to which he refers to as "Harv's Island"<br>
after which he invites the player to visit his island.</p>
<p>at Harv's Island the player can enter Photopia, which is a free photography studio Harvey made<br>
The player can decorate several rooms of the house with their catalog's furniture<br>
they can also invite other villagers to assist as models (and give them clothes for the photo)</p>
<p>Harvey also has no music associated with him or his island<br>
making it the only place in New Horizons (so far) without music.</p>
