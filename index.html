<h2>The basics about island life</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons is all about deserted island life with your fellow animal friends.<br>Forage, fish, leap, climb and craft your way into a nice life on your very own island!</p>
<p>But you might get weary of spending your time on island in a mere tent yes?<br>Well good news! by racking up enough Bells (which are the currency in Animal Crossing) you can pay off a no interest debt!<br>and upgrade your tent into a splendid house!</p>
<p>By merely spending time on your island you can earn Nook Miles!<br> but i can hear you ask "what are Nook Miles and what do they do?" good question!
<br>Nook Miles are a seperate currency from Bells you earn by completing specific challenges.<br>You are able to spend your Nook Miles inside Resident Services to obtain special goodies! (interested yet?)</p>
<p>By spending Nook Miles to get a Nook Miles ticket you can go to another Deserted island<br>and grab some goodies from there wether it be Fruit, Fish or anything else you see there it's yours!</p>
